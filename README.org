#+title: latex-to-unicode

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/ypsu/latex-to-unicode.

As the original repository, this fork is public domain.

* Changes

This fork removes all python GUI components. All conversion is done via the CLI.

The file ~convert.py~ is script which will await an input, then convert any
contained LaTeX into unicode.

Also, the unicode fractions now use ~\frac{num}{den}~. Though these are still
unicode vulgar fractions and therefore limited (could replace with
superscript/subscript later, though this is not the same).

* Usage

The script is entirely through CLI, meaning you can add any interface you want.

Example usage through CLI:

#+begin_src bash
$ echo "\\\alpha" | ./convert.py
Î±
#+end_src

Note that three backslashes were necessary.

[TODO] add a script that uses rofi as an interface
